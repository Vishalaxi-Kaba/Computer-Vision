## Motivation

I am one person who I like been productive, innovative and results oriented. Data science been an interdisciplinary field about processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, which is a continuation of some of the data analysis fields such as statistics, machine learning, data mining, and predictive analytics, encompasses all of my character traits listed above. Another motivating factor is my love for technology and doing research.
