# Computer Vision
In recent years, we've seen an extra-ordinary growth in Computer Vision, with applications in face recognition, image understanding, search, drones, mapping, semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles. A key part to many of these applications are visual recognition tasks such as image classification, object detection and image similarity.




## Overview
This repository provides examples and best practice guidelines for building computer vision systems.In this repository we are detecting the face & eye of a personality and also object detection from a video.
## Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.7. To install the required packages and libraries, pip install opencv-python or install in anaconda prompt as -c conda-forge opencv.
